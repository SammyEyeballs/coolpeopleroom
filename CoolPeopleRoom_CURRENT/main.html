    <h1>Welcome to the Cool People Room webpage!</h1>
    <h3>It's a place for cool people to gather.</h3>
    
    <p>If you don't know what the Cool People Room is, you can see for yourself, if you know what <a href="https://gokgs.com">KGS</a> is.</p> 
    <h5> *if you don't know what KGS is either, that's fine. I'm planning on adding a guide at some point so you can learn about KGS, if you like. If you end up downloading CGoban, signing up, and all that fun stuff, feel free to leave me a message (my username is simply 'Sam').</h5>
    
    <p>We're under "Social" in the room list categories.</p>
    
    <p>Here's the reasons for making this page:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The KGS room message limit is long enough to serve its purpose as a room for Go players, but as for Go players goofing around... not as much.</li>
      <li>Not only will we have a spot for quotes, we can put links of shared joy here.</li>
      <li>A secret I can't say much about yet - it's far too early... if it does end up being a thing, you'll surely know.</li>
      <li>fun</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things to read, things to remember, and a couple things you can probably safely skim over:</h2>
    <p>The <a href="quotes.html">quotes page</a> got updated! There are more quotes. And dates now. Not the fruit; that'd be fun, wouldn't it? Not the social activity either, though those can be fun, too. The regular DD/MM/YYYY type of date. Enjoy.</p>
    <p>NO BOTTING. Or perish. Up to you.<br>
    <br>
    <strike>----there may or may not be a website in the works, can't quite say, stay tuned anyway----</strike> &lt;- I can say now; it&#39;s a thing, and I think it's a good thing, or at least starting to be a good thing.<br>
    <br>
    Sam: Goin' on a walk. Goin' to see, to hear, to smell, to FEEL the world, it's fantastic, it's terrifying, it's whatever we make it to be. It's REAL and it's not ours for the taking, but ours for the MAKING.
    <br>
    Also Sam: To be spiritual is to be social with all entities we exist with.<br>
    <br>
    Again, Sam: How to be better:<br>
    1. Think of a quality you would like to be, and<br>
    2. Take a step<br>
    <br>
    ---ALERT__ALERT__Sam really needs to follow his own advice, <br>

    Note: I (this weird Sam guy) may or may not be kind of, just a tad, ever so slightly, crazy out of my mind...
