    <h1>Welcome to the Cool People Room!</h1>

    <p>If you don't know what it is, you can see for yourself, if you know what <a href="https://gokgs.com">KGS</a> is.</p>

    <p>We're under "Social" in the room list categories.</p>

    <p>Here's the purpose of this page</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The KGS room message limit is long enough to serve its purpose as a room for Go players, but as for Go players goofing around... not as much.</li>
      <li>Not only will we have a spot for quotes, we can put links of shared joy here.</li>
      <li>TBD</li>
    </ul>
