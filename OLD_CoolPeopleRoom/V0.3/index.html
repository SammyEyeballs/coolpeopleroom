    <h1>Welcome to the Cool People Room webpage!</h1>
    <h5><a href="#version">current site version</a> at bottom of page</h5>
    
    <p>If you don't know what it is, you can see for yourself, if you know what <a href="https://gokgs.com">KGS</a> is.</p> 
    
    <p>We're under "Social" in the room list categories.</p>
    
    <p>Here's the purpose of this page</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The KGS room message limit is long enough to serve its purpose as a room for Go players, but as for Go players goofing around... not as much.</li>
      <li>Not only will we have a spot for quotes, we can put links of shared joy here.</li>
      <li>TBD</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>The current message board printout:</h3>

NO BOTTING. Or perish.

----there may or may not be a website in the works, can't quite say, stay tuned anyway----

Goin' on a walk. Goin' to see, to hear, to smell, to FEEL the world, it's fantastic, it's terrifying, it's whatever we make it to be. It's REAL and it's not ours for the taking, but ours for the MAKING.

To be spiritual is to be social with all entities we exist with.

How to be better:
1. Think of a quality you would like to be, and
2. Take a step

    <h3>To-do:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Put together some more words that make sense to people who aren't in the loop yet. Like what KGS is, what the Cool People Room means (still figuring that one out myself, to be honest), and how you can join, if you like.
      <li>Put together a proper stylesheet? Monaco might not be the most well-suited font, I just like monospace fonts because they're consistent. Maybe just use CGoban's default font…
        <ul><li>Find out what CGoban's default font is</li></ul>
      <li>Get some input from the rest of the Cool People Room (if you didn't know, all of this stuff so far is by Sam)
    </ul>
    <h3 id="version">Site version: 0.3 (last updated <strike>Dec 17</strike> godammit I stayed up too late, it's half past one, *ahem* <em>Dec 18</em>)</h3>
    <p>Most recent update: added <a href="fun-stuffs.html">fun stuffs</a> (this is probably going to be one of the more substantial areas on the site, along with <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a>, in the future)</p>
