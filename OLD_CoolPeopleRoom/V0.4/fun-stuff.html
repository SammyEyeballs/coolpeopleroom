    <h2>Sam speaking - this is a list of stuff *I* like</h2>
    <p>Soon (hopfuelly), this page will include much more than simply what I like, because that would probably be uninteresting to people, and even if I happen to think I've got a decent collection of stuff here, I'm still curious to see what else ends up here.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>In no particular order (currently), here's some stuff on the Internet I've been collecting, and am grateful to the people who shared the content:</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RpcciQNLxZ4">"Burger Rain"</a>, by <a href="https://youtube.com/@TheAquabats">the Aquabats!</a> If you don't know what the Aquabats are, you should watch the TV show (which is on their YouTube channel). They were a ska band or something way back when, but my siblings and I grew up loving the show. We still love it, to clarify.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rV02k6DiWs0">‚≠ê[4K] Zelda Ocarina of Time Next Gen #1: Kakariko Village - Unreal Engine 5</a>, by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RwanLink">RwanLink</a>, who posts (somewhat infrequent) updates on YouTube. I like the level of detail environment design and music in this video. I wonder if this is how my dad saw the game when he played the original N64 game as a kid.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xQ8qaTCHoNE">Just a Big Pile of CG Stuff.</a>, by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IanHubert2">Ian Hubert</a>, the world-renowned storyteller famous for his ingenious shortcuts in CG, VFX and special effects. This is not at all the only video I recommend from Ian Hubert; maybe also see his ongoing <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LsGZ_2RuJ2A">DYNAMO DREAM project</a>, and definitely see his <a href="https://www.youtube-nocooke.com/embed/whPWKecazgM">World Building in Blender</a> talk.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Sv3xVOs7_No">Danny MacAskill's Imaginate</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danny_MacAskill">Danny MacAskill</a> is quite good at riding bikes.</li>

      <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alfalfa">Alfalfa Batmagoo</a> - alfalfa, one of the Cool People Room regulars, is currently working on getting the computer to play Go, using <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/009813549280053C?via%3Dihub">heirarchical neural networks</a>. It will also be able to teach, and it can actually recognize the moves and styles of players, when fed data. It's quite interesting stuff. </li>
      <li><a href="https://wiby.me">wiby.me</a> - I recently discovered this little search engine that indexes sites that have been manually submitted by people. It's focused primarily on bringing back the spirit of the &quot;<a href="https://yesterweb.org">yesterweb</a>&quot;. Blogs, homepages, those weird looking sites of the 90s/00s, all that fun stuff. It's quite interesting as somebody who never accessed the Internet until years after this phase of the Internet.</li>
