    <h1>Welcome to the Cool People Room webpage!</h1>
    
    <p>If you don't know what the Cool People Room is, you can see for yourself, if you know what <a href="https://gokgs.com">KGS</a> is.</p> 
    <h6> *if you don't know what KGS is either, that's fine. I'm planning on adding a guide at some point so you can learn about KGS, if you like. If you end up downloading CGoban and all that, feel free to leave me a message (my username is simply 'Sam').</h6>
    
    <p>We're under "Social" in the room list categories.</p>
    
    <p>Here's the purpose of this page</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The KGS room message limit is long enough to serve its purpose as a room for Go players, but as for Go players goofing around... not as much.</li>
      <li>Not only will we have a spot for quotes, we can put links of shared joy here.</li>
      <li>A secret I can't say much about yet - it's far too early... if it does end up being a thing, you'll surely know.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>The current message board printout on KGS (limited space, see the <a href="messageboard.html">message board</a> on site for full):</h4>
    <p>This is the Cool People Room. It's a place for cool people to gather.<br>

----there may or may not be a website in the works, can't quite say, stay tuned anyway----<br>
<br><p>
Goin' on a walk. Goin' to see, to hear, to smell, to FEEL the world, it's fantastic, it's terrifying, it's whatever we make it to be. It's REAL and it's not ours for the taking, but ours for the MAKING.</p>
<br>
To be spiritual is to be social with all entities we exist with.<br>
<br>
How to be better:<br>
1. Think of a quality you would like to be, and<br>
2. Take a step<br>

    <h3>To-do:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Put together some more words that make sense to people who aren't in the loop yet. Like what KGS is, what the Cool People Room means (still figuring that one out myself, to be honest), and how you can join, if you like.
      <li>Put together a proper stylesheet? <strike>Monaco might not be the most well-suited font, I just like monospace fonts because they're consistent. Maybe just use CGoban's default font…</strike>
        <ul><li><strike>Find out what CGoban's default font is</strike> As it turns out, the font used in CGoban is OS dependent. Just going with Lucinda Grande, as that's what it is for me (macOS)</li></ul>
      <li>Get some input from the rest of the Cool People Room (if you didn't know, all of this stuff so far is by Sam)
    </ul>
    <h3 id="version">Site version: 0.4 (last updated Dec 19)</h3>
    <p>Most recent update; quite a bit of things…</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of CSS changes to try to match the CGoban client for KGS
        <ul><li>Custom scrollbar (fun) and scroll buttons (pain)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Font change - Lucida Grande, because that's the default font the Java Swing UI framework that CGoban runs on uses when on macOS. Windows and Linux users, I don't know how to match the font on a website to the default font… yet… *crosses fingers*. Also, links are black and bold, like CGoban, but for practicality's sake, they change color like you'd expect when you hover over them.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Obviously you've probably noticed the green pattern and tabs up top; the green was easy, the tabs weren't too bad, but I would like to move them closer together, and believe it or not, that's the hardest thing so far…</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added a message board page; this is empty, but will become the new message board for the room later.
    </ul>
